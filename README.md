1. Sources of big data?

Sensor data
Machine Log Data
Data Storage
Public Web
Social Media
Business Apps
Media


2. 3 V's of Big Data?

Velocity
Volume
Variety

3. Horizontal & Vertical Scaling?

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more
 machines into your pool of resources. 
Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power(CPU, RAM) 
to an existing machine.

4. Need and Working of Hadoop?
But what exactly is Hadoop, and what makes it so special? Basically, it’s a way of storing enormous data sets across distributed clusters of servers and then running “distributed” analysis applications in each cluster.
Hadoop provides a cost effective storage solution for business.
It facilitates businesses to easily access new data sources and tap into different types of data to produce value from that data.
It is a highly scalable storage platform.
Hadoop is now widely used across industries, including finance, media and entertainment, government, healthcare, information services, retail, and other industries.

Problems with distributed processing:
1. Hardware failure: can be solved by redundancy
2. Coordinating the tasks and combining results from all machines

	Hadoop takes care of the above complexities and the challenges of network/distributed
programming
	HDFS (for storage)
	Map Reduce (for processing)
Two key concepts:
1. Storage (of data and results)
2. Processing (Analysis of data)
